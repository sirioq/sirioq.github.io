#What Can You Do in the Modern World With a 10 Year Old Laptop?

-----

Finding an old iBook lying around I was naturally curious to see if it still worked and whether the fast pace of technological advances had made it obsolete.

The laptop in question is an iBook G4 from 2005 running OS X 10.4 Tiger and came with happy memories but with only a 1.33 GHz processor and 1GB of ram I was sure to encounter severe limitaions. Undaunted I blew off the cobwebs, plugged it in and pressed the on button to be greeted by a reassuring noise and an Apple logo, so far so good.

## The Hardware

The monitor is actually a really nice size at 12 inches; not too big, not too small, and with a fairly square aspect ratio it feels as though there is more desktop space than many of the new machines which seem to be more aimed at watching films on. 

The keyboard is very good, full sized and responsive, and is a joy to type on.

There is no denying that the machine is heavy however and the battery life is very poor, I'm sure that is due to the age and number of charging cycles it has been through. 

So a few positives but I won't be lugging it around and I will have to be close to a power source but still useable.

## Test Run

There's still a lot of good software that came bundled with Tiger so if you want to use GarageBand for example although it won't have all the latest loops and features it is still useable and great fun. 

Word processors such as the excellent free, Bean work well as you would expect, TeXShop also runs smoothly if Latex is your thing as well as TextWrangler and I'm sure countless other text editors. 

No problems playing music although videos only play back smoothly in SD. It does have a dvd player too which you don't find too often these days.

So no real surprises but it is online where the real challenges will start.

The internet has changed hugely in ten years and the demands that websites make of computers will surely make this iBook unuseable. And to be honest these days with everything becoming cloud based, a computer that can't go online isn't going to be much good.

## Online

### Problem 1
Finding a browser.
Apple have stopped updating Safari for Tiger and using an out of date browser unnecessarily exposes you to security risks so I had a look around.
So it turns out that I'm not the only one intersted in using old computers and there are two browsers TenFourFox and WebKit which are stil maintained.

Do they work?

There is no denying that most pages are slow, you start to notice how many ads, videos and media have been added to the web which really slow down the whole experience. So while there are no problems with some sites you do need to be a bit selective.

What is interesting is that there seems to be a bit of a move back towards cleaner websites and a lot of this new content loads up instantly even on an old machine. 
Another great thing I found was SageMathCloud. This site gives me access to a full Linux terminal so I was able to set up a github repository remotely as well as being able to run Latex, Python etc. If the move to cloud computing continues there will be little need for laptops to have any real processing power as all the heavy lifting will be done externally.


## In conclusion

  * Still fun 
  * Still functional 
  * May even improve as more people embrace clean web design and cloud based computing.
 
 And finally it goes without saying that this post was done on said computer.
