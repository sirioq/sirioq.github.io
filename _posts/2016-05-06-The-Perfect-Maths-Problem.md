# The Search for the Perfect Mathematical Problem.

-----



Recently I've been looking through a number of maths problems from different sources, textbooks, Olympiad papers and 'recreational' mathematics books, in the hunt for what makes the perfect challenge.

Some problems have such a complicated setup that many readers will be turned off before they even get started.

*Three countrymen met at a cattle market. "Look here," said Hodge to Jakes, "I'll give you six of my pigs for 
one of your horses, and then you'll have twice as many animals here as I've got." "If that's your way of doing 
business," said Durrant to Hodge, "I'll give you fourteen of my sheep for a horse, and then you'll have three 
times as many animals as I." "Well, I'll go better than that," said Jakes to Durrant; "I'll give you four cows for a 
horse, and then you'll have six times as many animals as I've got here." 

No doubt this was a very primitive way of bartering animals, but it is an interest

Others require some trick or  word play which, to my mind, removes any satisfaction in solving them.* 

It soon became apparent that for my purposes the problem needed to be easily accessible, easily defined and the right level of complexity. There were a number of really engaging problems but the level of assumed mathematical knowledge was too great to have widespread appeal.

For example;

Finding **i<sup>i</sup>** 

is very elegant in the simplicity of the initial statement and the surprising fact that it gives a real answer. 
However solving it requires the understanding of natural logarithms and imaginary numbers which greatly limits its accessibility.

One of the great popularisers of recreational mathematics, Alfred Dudeny, talks about another issue in the preface to his book "The Cantebury Puzzles."

  *There are puzzles that look easy and are easy, puzzles that look easy and are difficult, puzzles that look difficult and are difficult, and puzzles that look difficult and are easy, and in each class we may of course have degrees of easiness and difficulty. But it does not follow that a puzzle that has conditions that are easily understood by the merest child is in itself easy. Such a puzzle might, however, look simple to the uninformed, and only prove to be a very hard nut to him after he had actually tackled it.*
  
  *For example, if we write down nineteen ones to form the number 1,111,111,111,111,111,111 and then ask for a number (other than 1 or itself) that will divide it without remainder, the conditions are perfectly simple, but the task is terribly difficult. Nobody in the world knows yet whether that number has a divisor or not. If you can find one, you will have succeeded in doing something that nobody else has ever done.*

What I like about this example is that it is trivial to solve with a simple bit of code and pretty much any computer. My old iBook G4 can do it in a matter of minutes with a brute force approach. (Unfortunately there are no divisors.)
