# The Search for the Perfect Mathematical Problem.

-----



Recently I've been looking through a number of maths problems from different sources, textbooks, Olympiad papers and 'recreational' mathematics books, in the hunt for what makes the perfect challenge.

It soon became apparent that for my purposes the problem needed to be easily accessible. There were a number of really engaging problems but the level of assumed mathematical knowledge was too great to have widespread appeal.

For example;

Finding **i<sup>i</sup>** 

is very elegant in the simplicity of the initial statement and the surprising fact that it gives a real answer. 
However solving it requires the understanding of natural logarithms and imaginary numbers which greatly limits its accessibility.

One of the great popularisers of recreational mathematics, Alfred Dudeny, talks about another issue in the preface to his book "The Cantebury Puzzles."

  *There are puzzles that look easy and are easy, puzzles that look easy and are difficult, puzzles that look difficult and are difficult, and puzzles that look difficult and are easy, and in each class we may of course have degrees of easiness and difficulty. But it does not follow that a puzzle that has conditions that are easily understood by the merest child is in itself easy. Such a puzzle might, however, look simple to the uninformed, and only prove to be a very hard nut to him after he had actually tackled it.*
  
  *For example, if we write down nineteen ones to form the number 1,111,111,111,111,111,111 and then ask for a number (other than 1 or itself) that will divide it without remainder, the conditions are perfectly simple, but the task is terribly difficult. Nobody in the world knows yet whether that number has a divisor or not. If you can find one, you will have succeeded in doing something that nobody else has ever done.*
