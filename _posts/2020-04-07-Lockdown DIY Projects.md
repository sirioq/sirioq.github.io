# DIY Tasks to Keep Busy During Lockdown

-----


With the world in lockdown with the Coronavirus we're spending increased hours indoors. Life has slowed down and it seems as though there are more hours in the day. Finally we have the spare hours to tackle all those tasks around the house which we have been so good at putting off.
Here I'm going to include a list of the jobs I've done so far as we enter the third week of this new life. Each project is one that is easy to do but has lasting impact, the sort of chores that we should be doing on a regular basis but somehow we've let slip for a number of years. Another bonus is they use up the free newspapers that are cluttering up the hallway.

1. Varnishing Outdoor Furniture

Equipment

*Outdoor Wood Varnish (does what it says on the tin)*

*Newspaper*

*Sandpaper*

*Paintbrush*

*Rag*

*Jamjar*



After a wet winter my outdoor table and sun lounger were looking very worn out. Looking around the flat I found a tin of wood seal, some sandpaper and a paintbrush so I was all set to go.

First wait for some dry weather and then spend the afternoon prepping the wood.

Sand all the surfaces to be varnished and then wipe them clean with a rag and some soapy water. The wood should be looking good now, nice and smooth but also a but naked!

Leave the wood to dry and wait until the sun goes down.

Once there is no direct sunlight on the furniture lay some newspaper underneath to catch any drips and then apply a thin layer of varnish with smooth strokes to all the surfaces. It might help to watch The Karate Kid before doing this.

Tidy up the newspaper, go to sleep and wake up the next morning to brand new outdoor furniture!

Time 

Afternoon and overight drying

Don't rush things, give youself about an hour to prep and an hour to varnish with plenty of time in between for drying.

Difficulty

Very easy a bit of elbow grease needed for the sanding but nothing too strenuous

Satisfaction

Furniture looks brand new once finished so you can sit back and enjoy the sunshine feeling pleased with yourself.

Although I might add another couple of layers in the next few days for extra protection.
